First of all to the GNOME community.

Now, right after that:
 - Evolution's devs, which without know it provide a huge bunch
   of code to this project
 - GNOME Documents' Cosimo Cecchi, again, but this he knew his code
   was going this ways
 - The guys on Evolution Data Server project for being a great help
   making me understand the internals of EDS
